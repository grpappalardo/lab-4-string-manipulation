In Lab 4 I performed string manipulation in 3 exercises. In exercise 1, I wrote a function that capitalized the first and fourth letter of a word. First I separated the argument into two parts, x and y, then I printed x concatenated to x, both with the .capitalize method.
In exercise 2, I worked to print out the scraped weather forecast data in a clean format. This exercise I had the most trouble with, and was not able to complete it. I received assistance from Aaron Deibele and Emily Williams with the code, but A.D. and I were unable to debug it. 
In Exercise, 3 I used RegEx to select the longitude/latitude section from the URL, then used indexing to only use the part after the @ sign. I split at the comma, then concatenated the variables with text to print out the information. I received assistance in this section from Aaron Deibele (gave me the idea to use RegEx), w3schools.com (tutorial), stackoverflow.com and regexr.com (formatting tool).
General additional assistance from Aaron Deibele and Google queries.
